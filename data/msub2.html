                A drone, in technological terms, is an <br>unmanned aircraft. ... Essentially, a drone<br> is a
                 flying robot that can be remotely<br> controlled or fly autonomously through<br>
                 software-controlled flight plans in their<br> embedded systems, working in conjunction <br>
                 with onboard sensors and GPS.

                In the early-to-mid 1990s, most<br> Web sites were based on complete <br>HTML pages.
                 Each user action required that a<br> complete new page be loaded from the server.<br>
                  This process was inefficient, <br>as reflected by the user experience: <br>all page
                   content disappeared, then the new <br>page appeared.</p>
                   <p>
                    Each time the browser reloaded a page <br>because of a partial change, all<br>
                     of the content had to be re-sent, even <br>though only some of the information <br>
                     had changed. This placed additional load<br> on the server and made bandwidth a  <br>
                     limiting factor on performance.

                MIT's ongoing efforts to make flying<br> drones ever smaller 
                has passed a new mil<br> with the latest version of its<br>
                 Navion navigation chip.<br> Essentially the brains for a drone<br>
                  the size of a honeybee, the <br>chip measures just 20 square.

                Ajax is not a single technology, but rather a<br>
                 group of technologies. HTML and CSS can be used in<br>
                  combination to mark up and style information.<br> The webpage
                   can then be modified by JavaScript to <br>dynamically display—and
                    allow the user to interact<br> with—the new information.
