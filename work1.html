    <strong>Document vs. DOM</strong>
    <p>
        HTML documents are delivered as "documents".[note 1] These are then parsed, which turns them<p> into the Document Object Model (DOM) internal representation, within the web browser.[note 2][note 3] Presentation by the web browser (such as</p> screen rendering or access by JavaScript) is then performed on this internal DOM, not the original document.
        
        <p>Early HTML documents (and to a lesser extent today's HTML documents) were largely invalid</p> <p>HTML and riddled with syntax errors. The parsing process was also required to "fix" these errors as best it could. The result was often not </p>correct (i.e., it did not represent what a careless coder had originally intended) but was at least valid according to the HTML standard. Only in the rarest cases would the parser abandon parsing altogether.</p><br>
        <strong>Elements vs. tags</strong>

        <p>
            As is generally understood, the position of an element is indicated as spanning from a start tag, possibly <P>including some child content, and is terminated by an end tag.[3] This is the case for many, but not all, elements within an HTML</P> document. The distinction is explicitly emphasised in HTML 4.01 Specification:</p><br>
            <p>Elements are not tags. Some people refer to elements as tags (e.g., "the P tag"). Remember that the element is one thing, and the tag (be it start or end tag) is another. For instance, the HEAD element is always present, even though both start and end HEAD tags may be missing in the markup.[3]</p><br>
       <p>As HTML (before HTML5) is based on SGML,[4] its parsing also depends on the Document Type Definition (DTD), specifically an HTML DTD (e.g. HTML 4.01[5][note 4]). The DTD specifies which element types are possible (i.e. it defines the set of element types) and also the valid combinations in which they may appear in a document. It is part of general SGML behavior that, where only one valid structure is possible (per the DTD), its explicit statement in any given document is not generally required. As a simple example, the <p> tag indicating the start of a paragraph element should be complemented by a </p> tag indicating its end. But since the DTD states that paragraph elements cannot be nested, an HTML document fragment <p>Para 1 <p>Para 2 <p>Para 3is thus inferred to be equivalent to <p>Para 1 </p><p>Para 2 </p><p>Para 3. (If one paragraph element cannot contain another, any currently open paragraph must be closed before starting another.) Because this implication is based on the combination of the DTD and the individual document, it is not usually possible to infer elements from document tags alone but only by using an SGML—or HTML—aware parser with knowledge of the DTD. HTML5 creates a similar result by defining what tags can be omitted.[6]</p><br> <a href="#top">GO</a>
